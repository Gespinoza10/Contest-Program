# Programming Contest Reader 

This program can score a small, three-problem programming contest.

Each input line contains 
seven single spaced fields (six integer fields followed by 1 string field) representing the raw 
score data. 

The ```RawScore.txt``` file contains records of a programming contest with 3 programming teams. 

Our program can take any programming contest record with the same format and calculate a score per team and wrote the output into ```ComputedScore.txt```.
